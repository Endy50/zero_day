__VirtualMachine__ is an *emulation* of a computer that acts as a *guest* hosted unto that computer. 
It is lightweight, no wonder since it runs using the computer disk space, c.p.u e.t.c
_Vagrant_ is a tool mounted on the VM through which the VM is utitilized as an operating system. 
The virtual environment can be more than one hosted unto a physical computer. This allows 
-other os to be run -previous version of an os to be run -beta software to be tested -better collaboration with multiple connections to a server.
